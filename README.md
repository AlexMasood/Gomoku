# Gomoku
Customisable board size and win condition for gomou with reinforcement learning.

This code is a adaption of the original tic tac toe game that allows for any board size and tokens in a row.
Training time is significantly longer than the original tic-tac-toe game this is mainly due to a mixture of diagonal row checking as well as more optional moves.
The AI will spend more time on random moves that make no progress.
It may also take longer for the AI to understand what is beneficial for it to win the game.
Attached will be some pre-trained AI data.
